# Project fraud prevention sytem

This project was created during the Data Science course by General Assembly that I followed Q2 & Q3 2021.

The goal of this project aims to develop a payment fraud detection system, able to detect fraudulent transactions following multiple fraud patterns using Python and multiple libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc).

The Datasets used are from a generator simulating a card company. The generator is created by [Yann-AÃ«l Le Borgne & Gianluca Bontempi](https://fraud-detection-handbook.github.io/fraud-detection-handbook/Chapter_3_GettingStarted/SimulatedDataset.html). A modified version of the generated is stored in this repository as "generator.ipynb"
